5️⃣ Finalized Command Structure

Command	Description	Context Updated
/start	Registers user, prompts team name	User, Active Gully
/gullies	Lists gullies & allows selection	Active Gully
/squad	View, add, remove players	Squad
/admin	Admin panel (restricted)	None
/help	Lists available commands	None

⸻

6️⃣ Optimized Context Management

✅ Only store what's needed:
	•	user_data["user"] → User info (ID, name)
	•	user_data["active_gully"] → Auto-set based on deep link
	•	user_data["selected_players"] → Only store player IDs, fetch details dynamically

❌ No full player lists in context (use pagination & DB fetching).

### 📌 Optimized Context Structure
```python
context.user_data = {
    "user_id": 123456,
    "active_gully_id": 42,
    "selected_player_ids": [1, 5, 8, ...],
    "current_squad": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Virat Kohli", "team": "RCB", "price": 10.0},
        # More players...
    ]
}
```

### 📌 Context Usage
- Minimal data stored in context
- Player details fetched from API when needed
- Selection state maintained between messages
- Gully activation persists across sessions
