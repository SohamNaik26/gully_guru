# Auction Management System

## Overview

The GullyGuru auction system follows a two-round process:
1. **Round 0 (Initial Squad Submission)**: Users submit their preferred squad of 18 players.
2. **Round 1 (Contested Players Auction)**: Live auction for players requested by multiple users.

This document outlines the implementation details for both rounds across different interfaces.

## User Interaction Patterns

### Conversation Handlers

The bot implements several conversation handlers to manage multi-step interactions:

1. **Squad Submission Flow**
   - Player selection interface
   - Budget validation
   - Confirmation

2. **Auction Bidding**
   - Bid amount selection/entry
   - Confirmation
   - Result notification

3. **Time Slot Voting**
   - Time slot selection
   - Vote confirmation
   - Results notification

### Keyboard Navigation

The bot uses a hierarchical keyboard navigation system:

1. **Player Selection**
   - Paginated player listings
   - Filters by team, role, price
   - Selected player indicators

2. **Bidding Interface**
   - Quick bid increments
   - Custom bid entry
   - Budget indicators

3. **Action Confirmations**
   - Explicit confirmation for bids
   - Cancel options to prevent accidental bids

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **Budget Information**
   - User budget is only visible to the user
   - Bid capacity is calculated privately
   - Remaining budget after acquisitions is private

2. **Strategic Information**
   - Bidding intentions are not revealed until confirmed
   - Squad composition during Round 0 is private until submission
   - Maximum bid calculations are private

### Transparency Balance

1. **Public Accountability**
   - All completed bids are publicly announced
   - Current highest bids are visible to maintain fairness
   - Final player allocations are public

2. **Private Decision-Making**
   - Users can evaluate bidding options privately
   - Budget management tools are provided confidentially
   - Outbid notifications are sent privately

## API System

### Core Components

The auction system is implemented through several API components:

1. **Auction Management**
   - Handles auction rounds and their states
   - Manages the transition between Round 0 and Round 1
   - Controls the auction flow and player selection

2. **Bidding System**
   - Processes bid placement and validation
   - Enforces bidding rules and constraints
   - Tracks highest bids and bidders

3. **Player Allocation**
   - Assigns players to users based on auction results
   - Handles uncontested player allocation
   - Updates user budgets after acquisitions

### Error Handling

The API provides standardized error responses for auction operations:

- 400: Bad Request (invalid bid amount, insufficient budget)
- 403: Forbidden (unauthorized bid attempt)
- 404: Not Found (auction or player not found)
- 409: Conflict (auction state conflict, outbid)
- 422: Unprocessable Entity (invalid squad composition)

Each error response includes:
- Error code
- Error message
- Optional details for debugging

### API Schemas

The auction API uses Pydantic models for request validation and response serialization:

#### Auction Schemas

```python
# Base model for auction rounds
class AuctionRoundBase(BaseModel):
    gully_id: int
