## Game Terminology and Concepts

### What is a Gully?

In GullyGuru, a "gully" represents a cricket community group or league. The term comes from "gully cricket," a form of street cricket played in the Indian subcontinent. Key characteristics of a gully include:

1. **Community Structure**
   - A gully is a self-contained community with its own members, admins, and teams
   - Each gully can have its own rules, scoring systems, and competition formats
   - Multiple gullies can exist independently, allowing users to participate in different communities

2. **Organizational Unit**
   - Gullies serve as the primary organizational unit within the system
   - All game activities, teams, and competitions exist within the context of a specific gully
   - Users can belong to multiple gullies simultaneously but interact with one at a time

3. **Telegram Integration**
   - Each gully is typically linked to a Telegram group for community interaction
   - The bot provides both group-wide and private command interfaces
   - Admins manage the gully through a combination of group and private commands

### Common Terminology

1. **Teams**
   - Groups of users within a gully who compete together
   - Teams have captains who manage team composition and strategy
   - Users can belong to only one team per gully

2. **Seasons**
   - Time-bounded competition periods within a gully
   - Seasons have defined start and end dates
   - Statistics and rankings reset between seasons

3. **Matches**
   - Individual cricket matches between teams
   - Matches have specific formats, teams, and scoring rules
   - Results contribute to season standings

4. **Predictions**
   - User forecasts about match outcomes
   - Predictions earn points based on accuracy
   - Prediction points contribute to individual and team rankings

## Information Visibility

### Public Information (Group Chat)

Information visible to all users in group chats:

1. **Group Management**
   - Group creation announcements
   - User join/leave notifications
   - Admin role assignments
   - Gully linking confirmations

2. **Administrative Announcements**
   - Season start/end notifications
   - Rule changes
   - Special events

3. **Gully Information**
   - Gully details and status
   - Participant list (without sensitive details)
   - Gully configuration changes

### Private Information (Direct Messages)

Information visible only to individual users:

1. **Personal Profile**
   - Complete profile details
   - Authentication information
   - Gully participation details
   - Role assignments

2. **Admin Controls**
   - User management options (for admins)
   - Gully configuration settings
   - System management tools

3. **Navigation Context**
   - Current active gully
   - Available gullies for switching
   - Personal role in each gully

## Group Setup Process

### 1. Create Telegram Group
- User creates a new Telegram group
- User adds GullyGuru bot to the group
- Bot automatically assigns admin role to the user who added it

### 2. Link Group to Gully
- Admin uses `/create_gully` command in the group
- Bot guides admin through gully creation process
- Bot automatically links the group to the newly created gully

### 3. Add Users to Group
- Admin adds users to the Telegram group
- Users join the gully using `/join_gully` command
- Bot confirms successful joining

### 4. Assign Roles
- Admin assigns additional admins using `/add_admin` command
- Bot confirms role assignments
- Admin configures gully settings

## Enhanced Group Setup and Admin Workflow

### Streamlined Group Creation Process

The GullyGuru system provides a streamlined workflow for creating and managing Telegram groups and gullies:

1. **Initial Bot Interaction**
   - User starts a private chat with the GullyGuru bot
   - User completes basic registration with `/start` command
   - Bot provides guidance on creating a new gully

2. **One-Click Group Creation**
   - User selects "Create New Gully" from the private chat menu
   - Bot offers two options:
     - Create a new Telegram group automatically
     - Link to an existing Telegram group
   - For automatic creation, bot creates the group and adds the user as admin
   - For existing groups, bot generates a unique invite link to be added

3. **Guided Setup Process**
   - Once the bot is in the group, it initiates a guided setup wizard
   - Step-by-step configuration with inline buttons for easy navigation
   - Visual progress indicators show completion status
   - Setup can be paused and resumed at any point

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - After setup, admins access a comprehensive dashboard via `/admin_panel`
   - Dashboard provides quick access to all admin functions
   - Real-time metrics and status information
   - Actionable alerts for required admin attention

### Admin and User Navigation

The system provides clear navigation paths between personal and group spaces:

1. **Context-Aware Command Interface**
   - Commands automatically adapt based on chat context (group vs. private)
   - Bot provides guidance on which commands work in which context
   - Quick-access buttons for switching between contexts

2. **Private-to-Group Navigation**
   - From private chat, users can quickly access their groups
   - "My Groups" menu shows all groups with active status
   - One-tap navigation to switch Telegram to the selected group

3. **Group-to-Private Navigation**
   - In group chats, certain commands automatically redirect to private chat
   - Bot sends private message with deep link to continue the interaction
   - After private interaction, bot confirms completion in the group

4. **Admin Handoff Protocol**
   - Structured process for transferring admin responsibilities
   - Current admin nominates new admin via `/nominate_admin` command
   - Nominee receives confirmation request in private chat
   - Upon acceptance, permissions are automatically transferred
   - Group receives notification of admin change

## User Interaction Patterns

### Conversation Handlers

The bot implements several conversation handlers to manage multi-step interactions:

1. **Registration Flow**
   - Username selection
   - Team name selection
   - Confirmation

2. **Gully Creation**
   - Name and description entry
   - Configuration settings
   - Confirmation

3. **Profile Editing**
   - Field selection
   - New value entry
   - Confirmation

### Keyboard Navigation

The bot uses a hierarchical keyboard navigation system:

1. **Main Menu**
   - Profile management
   - Gully navigation
   - Settings access

2. **Contextual Submenus**
   - Dynamic options based on current state
   - Back navigation to parent menus
   - Quick actions for common tasks

3. **Action Confirmations**
   - Explicit confirmation for irreversible actions
   - Cancel options to prevent accidental actions

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **User Information**
   - Personal details are only visible to the user and admins
   - Authentication tokens are securely stored
   - Private messages are not logged in group contexts

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - Admin-only features are properly restricted
   - User permissions are validated for each action
   - Group-specific roles are enforced

### Transparency Balance

1. **Public Group Actions**
   - Group-wide announcements for important events
   - Visible role assignments for accountability
   - Public confirmation of administrative actions

2. **Private User Management**
   - Personal settings managed in private chats
   - Sensitive information handled in direct messages
   - Profile details protected from unauthorized access

## API System

### Core Components

The user management system is implemented through several API components:

1. **User Management**
   - Handles user registration and profile management
   - Manages user authentication and session tracking
   - Controls user preferences and settings

2. **Group Management**
   - Processes Telegram group registration and configuration
   - Manages group-to-gully linking
   - Tracks group membership and roles

3. **Gully Management**
   - Handles gully creation and configuration
   - Manages gully membership and roles
   - Controls gully-specific settings

### Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:

1. User registers via Telegram bot
2. API creates user record and generates a JWT token
3. Subsequent API requests include the token in the Authorization header
4. API validates the token and identifies the user

### Error Handling

The API provides standardized error responses for user management operations:

- 400: Bad Request (invalid input data)
- 401: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found (user, group, or gully not found)
- 409: Conflict (username already exists, already in gully)
- 422: Unprocessable Entity (invalid data format)

Each error response includes:
- Error code
- Error message
- Optional details for debugging

### API Schemas

The user management API uses Pydantic models for request validation and response serialization:

#### User Schemas

```python
# Base model with common user fields
class UserBase(BaseModel):
    username: str
    first_name: str
    last_name: Optional[str] = None

# Create model for registration
class UserCreate(UserBase):
    telegram_id: int

# Response model with additional fields
class UserResponse(UserBase):
    id: int
    telegram_id: int
    active_gully_id: Optional[int]
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    
    class Config:
        from_attributes = True
```

#### Gully Schemas

```python
# Base model for gully data
class GullyBase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str

# Create model for new gullies
class GullyCreate(GullyBase):
    pass

# Response model with additional fields
class GullyResponse(GullyBase):
    id: int
    creator_id: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    is_active: bool
    
    class Config:
        from_attributes = True
```
