    - `submit_squad_callback`: Submit final squad
    - `confirm_submit_callback`: Confirm squad submission

### 2. Team Module Updates
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- **Details**:
  - Update `src/bot/features/team.py` to include squad building options
  - Add `edit_squad_callback` function to allow users to edit their squad

### 3. Admin Module Updates
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- **Details**:
  - Update `src/bot/features/admin.py` to include auction initiation
  - Add `admin_start_auction_callback` function to check if all users have submitted squads
  - Add `confirm_start_auction_callback` function to start the auction

### 4. Module Registration
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- **Details**:
  - Update `src/bot/features/__init__.py` to register the new handlers

## Implementation Details

### Using Auction Queue for Draft Squad
- Use `AuctionStatus.DRAFT` for players in the draft stage
- When a squad is submitted, update status to `AuctionStatus.PENDING`
- When auction starts, update contested players to `AuctionStatus.BIDDING` and uncontested to `AuctionStatus.COMPLETED`

### Inline Keyboard Approach
- Use inline keyboards instead of slash commands for user interactions
- Implement pagination for player selection
- Provide filtering options by player type
- Show squad summary with budget and player count

### User Flow
1. User selects "Build Squad" from main menu
2. User filters players by type or searches by name
3. User adds players to draft squad
4. User reviews squad and submits when ready
5. Admin checks submission status and starts auction when all users have submitted

## Testing Plan

### Database Testing
- Verify that `has_submitted_squad` and `submission_time` fields are added to `GullyParticipant` model
- Verify that `AuctionStatus.DRAFT` is available in the enum

### API Testing
- Test each API endpoint with valid and invalid inputs
- Verify proper error handling and validation

### Bot Testing
- Test the complete user flow from squad building to submission
- Test admin functionality for checking submission status and starting auction
- Verify proper handling of edge cases (budget limits, player count limits)

## Implementation Order
1. Database updates (‚úÖ Completed)
2. API implementation (üîÑ In Progress)
3. Bot functionality (‚è≥ Pending)

## Requirements from User Input
- Use existing auction queue for player selection
- Track whether participants have submitted their squads
- Use inline keyboards instead of slash commands
- Ensure admin oversight of the process
- Handle edge cases for player selection and budget limits
- Integrate with existing UI/UX flow

This implementation plan addresses all the requirements discussed and provides a clear roadmap for completing the squad building feature.
